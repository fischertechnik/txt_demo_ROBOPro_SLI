# What is in my toolbox?

As software developer you need a tool box, your software development environment. For the more experience software engineers this is a personal set of tools. But were to start as beginner?<br/> Creative programming and problem solving is more then only entering program code and compiling. It has also something to do with:
- understand and describe the problem
- create and describe a solution
- implement this solution including documentation
- testing an error searching.

For this there is  needed a set of tools. Hereby an overview:

- a program development environment with some plug in tools, like
- a remote SSH terminal
- a SFTP file transfer tools
- RoboPro 4.6.6
- TXT with firmware 4.6.6 or 4.7.0
- a  documentation generator
- a basic text editor for text (and later markdown, XML/JSON/HTML, etc.)


## Toolbox for the starter

This is a piece of advice only. However, these tools can be used in this introduction.

### Step 1 What to download?

1. Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers<br/>
Versie: Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers 2020-06 (r=release version) or higher (only 64 bits)<br/>

	> [Download installer for Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers 2020-06 (r=release version)]( https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/oomph/epp/2020-06/R/eclipse-inst-win64.exe)  Remark: This is only the installer.

     or

	> [Select yourself from download page](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2020-06/r)

	> Here you can find [additional help]( https://help.eclipse.org/2020-06/index.jsp) <br/>

   Eclipse has two different possibilities to install additional functionality.

1. Linaro<br/>
The TXT firmware is using gcc-linaro-7.2.1-2017.11-i686-mingw32_arm-linux-gnueabihf.

   [Download]( https://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/7.2-2017.11/arm-linux-gnueabihf/gcc-linaro-7.2.1-2017.11-i686-mingw32_arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.xz)

1. FileZilla<br/>

   [Download]( https://filezilla-project.org/download.php)

1. Putty<br/>

    [Download](https://putty.org/)


1. Notepad ++<br/>

    [Download]( https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)
    This software can be use to inspect log files and edit text files.<br/>
 [Plugins overview]( https://npp-user-manual.org/docs/plugins/)<br/>
 [Plugins List](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/nppPluginList/), suggestions for Plugins:<br/>
    - MarkdownViewerPlusPlus

1. ATOM editor<br/>

   [Download](https://atom.io/ Atom 1.46.0 ot higher) <br/>
   Packages: [the functionality of Atom can be extended with the so called packages.](https://atom.io/packages)<br/>
Suggestions for packages:
    - language-markdown
    - markdown-preview-plus
    - markdown-image-paste

1. VNC-client<br/>
   The TXT has an VNC-server. This makes it possible that the screen of the TXT can be control remotely. A nice possibility when you RoboPro program runs locally.<br/>
   To make use of the TXT VNC-server you will need a VNC-viewer (client):
   [Download RealVNC viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/)

1. Graphviz<br/>
For the graphical part of the DOxyGen documentation tool you will need to install graphviz.
[Download](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/_pages/Download/Download_windows.html)

1.	RoboPro<br/>
    [See here for RoboPro 4.6.6 and the firmware 4.6.6 and 4.7.0](
https://github.com/fischertechnik/FT-TXT/releases)<br/>
Firmware 4.7.0 can be boot from SD-card and used in corporation with RoboPro 4.6.6.

### Step 2 How to install?
Note: Graphviz needs to be install after the installing  Eclox from the Eclipse Marktplace.

#### Maps
First of all, create on the same drive, the following maps:
-	\eclipse\\<br/>
  Installation map for Eclipse
-	\workspaces\\<br/>
  Map were you can put the root maps for the Eclipse workspaces.
-	\TXT\<br/>
-	\TXT\toolchain\<br/>
  Installation map for the Linaro toolchain
-	\Log\<br/>
- \Log\Putty\<br/>
   Map for the Putty Log-files

#### Software
After this, start with the installation of the downloaded software
-	Install Notepad ++, Atom ,FileZilla, Putty and RealVNC viewer<br/>
 like you are used to doing with Windows programs.<br/>
 Their installation programs will guide you through the process.


- Eclipse<br/> 
Run the installer.<br/>
Install “Eclipse IDE for C/C++ developers” in the map: `H:\eclipse\cpp-2020-03`.<br/>
The installer will also install or ask for “Java 1.8+ VM”.<br/>
Eclipse is a JAVA application and needs Java.<br/>
See also the following 3 screen dumps:

<img src="./docs/toolbox/install(Eclipse02).png" width="40%" >
<img src="./docs/toolbox/install(Eclipse03).png" width="40%" >

- Linaro <a id="linaromap"></a>

    Last but not least is making the Linaro toolchain available.<br/>
Unzip the Linaro toolchain into the map `<drive>\TXT\toolchain\`.<br/>
You will get something like this.<br/>
 `H:\TXT\toolchain\gcc-linaro-7.2.1-2017.11-i686-mingw32_arm-linux-gnueabihf`<br/>
In this case the drive is `H:` but it could be a different drive. This path `<drive>\TXT` you will need later as [workspace Environment variable](./HowToStartWithFtTxtWorkspace.md#wsenvvar) to configurate the tool chain in your C/C++ project in Eclipse.<br/>
An image of how this looks like in the Windows explorer:

### Step 3 How to setup the software?
Prepare the TXT, the SSH remote console) and SFTP (remote file system)
Setting up FileZilla and Putty. Install DoxyGen with Eclipse Marktplace.

#### How to prepare the TXT controller?

  It is time to create the connections with your TXT.

  - Start your TXT and test the connection with RoboPro.
  - Write down the IP-address of this connection. It does not matter if you are using Bluetooth, USB, Wifi or Wifi-access point.
  - Don’t forget to activate on the your the SSH Daemon, VNC server and WEB server (fw 4.6.6 and fw 4.7.0) and SD boot (4.6.6) (The screen shot are from fw 4.7.0)

#### How to set up Putty for a SSH connection with the TXT? <a id="puttysetup"></a>
Putty is a remote console; it can be used to work with LINUX command.
We are using Putty as console.

Start Putty and create a new SSH-session with the general user ROBOPro.
The user name: `ROBOPro`, the password: `ROBOPro`
- Fill in the IP-address from your TXT01
- Choose SSH
- Fill in the map for the logfiles: `H:/Log/Putty/putty_&Y-&M-&D_&T.log` .
-	As remote command: [screen -r](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/screen-command-in-linux-with-examples/)
   You can find what this means in the Linux command help on the internet.<br/>
   When you leave this line blanc, you will get the LINUX command prompt.
	 - Save these settings and start the connection.
	 - Run with RoboPro a small RoboPro program and observe what the console shows you.
	 - Go with the Windows file manager to the \Log\Putty\ map and open the log file with Notepad++.
	 Now you can also inspect the results. When the log file changes, Notepad++ will reload the file.
	 - Warning: Use only the TXT root account for exceptional activities.

<img src="./docs/toolbox/install(Putty03).png" width="45%" >

#### How to set up FileZilla? <a id="filezillasetup"></a>
FileZilla is a file transfer program.
- Start FileZilla, go to the “file” menu and start the “site manager”.
- Create a “new site” for a SFTP- (Secure File Transfer Protocol)
for the IP-address of the TXT controller.
The user name: `ROBOPro`,
 the password: `ROBOPro`.
  - Warning: Use only the root account for very special activities

<img src="./docs/toolbox/install(FileZilla01).png" width="60%" >

Start FileZilla and observe what you are seeing.<br/>
Remark: The public maps can also be inspected and maintained via the TXT web interface.<br/>
See for an introduction the first part on [this link:]( https://github.com/fischertechnik/txt_training_factory/blob/master/doc/WEBServer_de.md)


<img src="./docs/toolbox/install(FileZilla02).png" width="60%" >

-  The “default local directory” is for later.
-  The “default remote library” is normally `/opt/Knobloch/`.
    Here you will find the maps for the `Data`, `libs`, `C-program`, etc.

#### How to set up Eclipse?
How to work with the SLI workspace and set up a new project will discuss later. But we still have to install the DoxyGen tool as code documentation plugin for Eclipse.

   installation: [Eclox via Eclipse Markplace](https://anb0s.github.io/eclox/),<br/> [See also](http://www.doxygen.nl/download.html)
   - Start Eclipse
   - Go to top menu `Help`
   - Select `Eclipse Markplace..`
   - Search for `Eclox`
   - Install eclox
   - `Install Now` and `Finish`
<img src="./docs/toolbox/install(DoxyGen01).png" width="45%">

<img src="./docs/toolbox/install(DoxyGen02).png" width="45%">

#### Install Graphviz
Install the Windows application `Graphviz`.<br/> **Check after the installation** if the path to the bin has been added to the System Environment variable `Path`!
